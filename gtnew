Usage: $(basename "$0") PRESET [REMOTEREPONAME]

This command initializes the Current Working Directory (CWD)
for version control with git and creates a remote repository.

'$(basename "$0")' performs the following actions:

1   If the CWD is already under version control with git,
    this script will abort.

2.  If the CWD is empty, an empty file called 'placeholder' is
    created.

3.  If the optional argument REMOTEREPONAME is specified, this is
    used as the remote repository name. Otherwise the name of the
    CWD is used.

4.  '$(basename "$0")' creates a repository on the remote
    location. If this action fails for some reason, the
    script aborts.
    The full location of the repository is determined based
    on PRESET and REMOTEREPONAME.
    For instructions on how to create and use presets, see the
    comments preceding the function called 'loadPreset' in the
    file 'gt-utils'.

5.  A .git directory is initialized in your CWD, and the 'origin'
    property in .git/config is set to the repo created on the
    remote location.

6.  The script 'gtcommit' is called to add the entire git working
    tree to the staging area (option '-A') and commit it with the
    message 'First commit'.

7.  The first commit is pushed to the origin repository.
