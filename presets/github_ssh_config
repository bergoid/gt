# Example ssh config file
#
# 1. Generate public/private key pair
#    (choose a meaningful name for ALIAS):
#
#     ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/ALIAS
#
# 2. On the Github website, in your USER account settings,
#    create an SSH key and paste the contents of ~/.ssh/ALIAS.pub
#    in the text field.
#
# 3. Copy this file to ~/.ssh/ and name it 'config'. Replace
#    'USER' and 'ALIAS' with their actual values.
#
# 4. Create a preset file by copying github_preset to ~/.gtpresets/
#    and replacing 'USER' and 'ALIAS' with their actual names.
#
# 5. For repositories that were already cloned, change their remote
#    URL:
#
#    git remote set-url origin ALIAS:USER/REPONAME.git


# USER at github
Host ALIAS
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ALIAS
